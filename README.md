# Timestone üóø

Timestone is a library to improve unit tests for time-dependent, concurrent go code. Existing libraries such as [Quartz](https://github.com/coder/quartz) or [Clock](github.com/benbjohnson/clock) show the need for such a tool, yet have various shortcomings, for example not being able to reliably prevent race-conditions in tests, or being difficult to read and understand when used.

### Goals

This library is built around the following primary design goals:

- ü§å Eliminate flaky unit tests
- üßπKeep unit tests free of boilerplate syncing code and focussed on assumptions and expectations
- üê≠ As little invasive as possible to the tested implementation

Secondary goals are a good separation of concerns and extensive test coverage for the library itself.

### Design principles

To offer a high-level API that keeps manual syncing code out of unit tests, Timestone takes an opinionated, use-case-oriented approach rather than attempting to substitute low-level runtime primitives like timers and tickers. However this approach can be limiting, and there may be a need to extend the library‚Äôs public interface to support additional use cases. For instance, Timestone‚Äôs public model already includes passing the commonly used `context.Context` but the `simulation` implementation doesn't alawys respect it. Another example is a cron syntax for scheduling recurring tasks which could be easily integrated but is not included yet.

## Concepts

To achieve its goals, Timestone aims to encapsulate concurrency. Instead of directly invoking goroutines, the library provides a `Scheduler` interface with methods for scheduling `Action`s, such as one-time or recurring tasks. There are two implementations of the `Scheduler`: `system.Scheduler` and `simulation.Scheduler`. While the former uses standard library runtime primitives to dispatch actions, the latter employs a run loop to control where actions are scheduled. Through various configuration options, the scheduling mode and order of actions can be controlled, and action dependencies can be setup.

To see how this works in practice, take a look at the `examples` package, which contains functional test cases that serve as integration tests for the Timestone library, as well as demonstrative use cases.

The following sections provide a more detailed explanation:

### Scheduler

One of the main challenges in eliminating race conditions from unit tests is handling goroutines. Non-deterministic by nature, goroutines provide no guarantee on the order in which concurrent code will be executed by the Go runtime. To address this problem in unit tests, Timestone offers a `Scheduler` interface designed to run code concurrently while encapsulating the underlying complexity:

```go
type Scheduler interface {
    Clock
    PerformNow(ctx context.Context, action Action)
    PerformAfter(ctx context.Context, action Action, duration time.Duration)
    PerformRepeatedly(ctx context.Context, action Action, until *time.Time, interval time.Duration)
}
```

Where you would normally call `go func() {...}()`, when working with Timestone you instead use the `PerformNow` method of the `Scheduler`. The `PerformAfter` and `PerformRepeatedly` methods offer convenient alternatives to using `time.Timer` and `time.Ticker` within goroutines for scheduling function execution.

While the `system.Scheduler` implementation of the `Scheduler` interface uses the mentioned runtime scheduling primitives, the `simulation.Scheduler` implementation is where the real magic happens.

Rather than immediately running an action within a goroutine, the `simulation.Scheduler` creates an event generator for it. The events it produces will then be executed from either the `ForwardOne` or `Forward` methods, advancing the `simulation.Scheduler`‚Äôs clock either to the next event or through all events scheduled to occur within a specified `time.Duration`. Additional configuration can be provided for individual actions or entire groups, allowing control over the scheduling order of simultaneous events or injecting dependencies between actions, delaying the execution of certain actions until their dependencies have completed.

To provide this level of control, the `simulation.Scheduler` uses a run loop that iterates over all events in a well-defined order until no event remains. For each event, its configuration and default settings are considered to determine whether it should execute sequentially or asynchronously, or if it must wait on other events.

### Action

An `Action` defines an interface for a function to be executed, along with a name used to associate it with a configuration.

```golang
type Action interface {
	Perform(ActionContext)
	Name() string
}
```

The `ActionContext` provided to the `Perform` method offers contextual information such as a clock and a control mechanism that supports the recursive scheduling of additional actions when using the `simulation.Scheduler`. You can either use the included `SimpleAction` as a convenient wrapper or create your own implementation.

### Event

An `Event` is an internal concept of the `simulation.Scheduler` that combines an `Action` with a `time.Time` that determines when it should be executed. These events are produced from actions by event generators. For example, when calling `simulation.Scheduler.PerformRepeatedly`, a corresponding event generator is registered, which repeatedly places events into the event loop according to its settings.

When using the `simulation.Scheduler` for deterministic unit tests, you configure events by providing `EventConfiguration`s. These configurations can target events by the name of their embedded action, or individually by their name and execution time.

## Contributing

This project is in its early stages, and contributions are welcome. Feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request (PR). When submitting a PR, it would be helpful to reference an open issue so that there is documentation for future reference.

Currently, the most important features on the agenda for this project are:
- Pipeline for linting and automatic unit tests before merging
- Support for canceled contexts
